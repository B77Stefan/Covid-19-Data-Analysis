### Project Overview
This portfolio demonstrates SQL expertise in analysing *COVID-19 data*, focusing on key metrics such as infection rates, vaccination efficiency, and the relationship between population and health outcomes. Key techniques include advanced SQL functions like *CTEs*, *joins*, *window functions*, and *temporary* tables to generate actionable insights for global health trends and vaccination strategies. ðŸ˜„

---

### Key Features 
- **Infection Rate & Vaccination Analysis**: Comparative analysis of infection rates versus population and vaccination coverage.
  - This is a subpoint
- **Vaccination Efficiency**: Ranked countries by vaccination efficiency, using rolling sums for accurate population coverage analysis.
- **Data Visualisation Preparation**: SQL views and tables created for seamless integration into data visualisation tools.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilisation of CTEs, window functions, temporary tables, and joins to extract meaningful patterns from large datasets.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Analysis
CTE functions used to produce the vaccination rate ratio
```SQL
WITH PopvsVac (continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated) AS
			  (
				SELECT DEA.CONTINENT, DEA.LOCATION, DEA.DATE, DEA.POPULATION, VAC.NEW_VACCINATIONS, 
				SUM(CONVERT(INT,VAC.NEW_VACCINATIONS)) OVER (PARTITION BY DEA.LOCATION ORDER BY DEA.LOCATION, DEA.DATE) AS ROLLINGPEOPLEVACCINATED
				FROM CovidDeaths DEA
				INNER JOIN CovidVaccinations VAC
					ON DEA.location = VAC.location AND DEA.date = VAC.date
				WHERE DEA.continent IS NOT NULL
				)
SELECT *, ROUND(RollingPeopleVaccinated/population * 100,2) AS PercentagePeopleVaccinated
FROM PopvsVac
ORDER BY 2,3 ASC;
```

### Results and findings

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis results, we recommend the following:

## Limitations
Actions that limits the quality of the analysis. E.g. Outlier data (Data from 2019 was removed) was removed for accurate results
